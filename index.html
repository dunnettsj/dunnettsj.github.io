<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>This is somewhere for me to construct a blog covering things I'm interested in as well as my jounrey to begin a career in software engineering/web design.</h2>

<h3>Some of the things I'll cover are:
    <ul>
        <li>Programming (and what I come across as I learn.)</li>
        <li>Strength and Conditioning (or resistance training in general)</li>
        <li>Videogames, the videogaming industry, consoles and pc gaming, etc.</li>
    </ul>
</h3>

<p>I will be updating this blog as often as possible to create a fully-functioning site that will be able to grow along with me.</p>

<p>Some of the things I will use may be directly pulled from one of my previous projects from codepen.io</p>
